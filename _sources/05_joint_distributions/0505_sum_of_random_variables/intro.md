# Sum of Random Variables

This section details the sum of random variables. In the example {ref}`simplified-probit-model`,
we can model $Y = X + \epsilon$ where $X$ is a random variable and $\epsilon$ is a random error term 
that follows a certain distribution. This section formalizes what happens when we sum two or more
distributions.
