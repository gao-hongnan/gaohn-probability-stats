## Problem 1

[Question 11 of Chapter 3 in Introduction to Probability, Statistics, and Random Processes](https://www.probabilitycourse.com/chapter3/3_3_0_chapter3_problems.php)

The number of emails that I get in a weekday (Monday through Friday) can be modeled by a 
Poisson distribution with an average of $\frac{1}{6}$ emails per minute. 
The number of emails that I receive on weekends (Saturday and Sunday) can be modeled by a 
Poisson distribution with an average of $\frac{1}{30}$ emails per minute.

a) What is the probability that I get no emails in an interval of length 4 hours on a Sunday?

b) A random day is chosen (all days of the week are equally likely to be selected), and a random 
interval of length one hour is selected on the chosen day.
It is observed that I did not receive any emails in that interval. 
What is the probability that the chosen day is a weekday?
