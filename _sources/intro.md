# Introduction

This repository follows closely with the book [Introduction to Probability for Data 
Science](https://probability4datascience.com/).

```{admonition} Disclaimer
:class: note

This documentation has many examples and problems solved. However, since I am
still learning, there may be conceptual errors. If you find any, please let me
know!

There's a lot of content (definitions, intuitions and theorems) that are from the book, 
so I don't take credit for that.
