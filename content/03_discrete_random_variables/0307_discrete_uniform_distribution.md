# Discrete Uniform Distribution

## Definition

```{prf:definition} Discrete Uniform Distribution
:label: def:discrete_uniform

Let $X$ be a **discrete random variable** that follows a Uniform distribution over the set $\S$.
This means that $X=x$ has an equally likely chance of being drawn.

Then the probability mass function (PMF) of $X$ is given by 

$$
\P(X=x) = \dfrac{1}{\lvert \S \rvert}
$$

Note:

1. It is non-parametric because there are no parameters associated.
