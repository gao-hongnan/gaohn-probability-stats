# Important

This section is a placeholder as need time to digest.

- Revisit the idea of the histogram, even a section during PMF is good as a refresher!
- Try to think about how to write PMF as an ideal histogram into my notes, especially from the machine learning perspective.
- Early mention of empirical CDF vs CDF, empirical histogram vs PMF
  
## Rough notes


### Ideal histogram

- Experiment: roll a dice once to see what number comes up


- Prof drew a very important diagram towards the end of lecture 10, on how histograms tend to their PMF as a number of experiments tend to infinity, and how each histogram mean (sample mean) tends to its PMF's expectation (population mean). I believe this part is very very important and needs to be bookmarked in my notes and treated as a header. This is because he mentioned how sample mean is random but population mean (expectation) is deterministic, which implies histograms are random (i.e randomly drawn samples from the population while PMF is deterministic (?)).

### Expectation is deterministic
