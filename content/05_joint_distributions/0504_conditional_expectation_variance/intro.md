# Conditional Expectation and Variance

## Introduction

The conditional probability of a random variable $X$ given a random variable $Y$ is a legitimate
probability in terms of $X$, and consequently, we can use it to compute the conditional expectation
of $X$ given $Y$.  A simple example is that we have a population of people, consisting of male and females,
alongside with their weights. It may be more useful to know the average weight of a particular 
gender than the average weight of the population. More concretely, let $X$ be the weight of a person
and $Y$ be the gender, then we are interested in the $\mathbb{E}[X|Y]$ rather than just $\mathbb{E}[X]$.
